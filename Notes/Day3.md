# Notes
  -In the first hour, we learnt about financial statements and had a look at stock market data. We learnt terminology
such as candlesticks, and different patterns found in stock graphs, like reversal, hammer, wedge.

  -We then learnt the code to create a similar stock graph on RStudio by importing stock data from online
  
  -We learnt about new packages such dyGraphs, and quantmod, and their functions, dyRangeSelector, dyLegend, chartSeries()
  
  -We noticed that there was a similarity in the MC graph and the daily returns graph and decided to use the MCTS to make
    predictions about the graph
   
  -We started learning about the MCTS in detail, which is the Monte Carlo Tree Search. We realised that there are multiple generations
    required to get an accurate value, so first we learnt how to code 1 generation, and then everytime we started another generation,
    we used the mean value from the previous day's return in the actual stock to graph the new generation.
    
  -Towards the tail end of the class, we had Diana teach us the basicsof python and take us through variables, lists,dictionaries, dataframes,
and how to manipulate dataframes to extract optimal data
